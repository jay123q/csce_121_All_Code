// void means return nothing
// walking through starter code tonight Rename code and remove specialspaces
// include string variables #include <string>
// #include <sstream> put things in and take things out of strings
// #include allow limits
// DONT CHANGE THE STARTER CODE
// std::getline; program takes a whole input of text as a string


// 19-25 of variables to use later
// void get_catergory_and_score(const string& line, ) passing along function with an & or a star


// We have created string variable that is only a line, and we read from the keyboard until the line is empty

//in the get_category_and_score(line,&category,&score) is the category x y or z we will need to do things

//  add all grades and print out averages

// 83 havve an if statement for a 90 A etc

// 91 - 96  says every line of the file  is going to read something so  this is yur read statement
// sin >> is a string recieve characters rather than a int

// to avoid an error where the code goes  into an infinity loop we have sin.clear(); that says forget you/user messed up and move on

// to have C++ read the files use terminal ./filename  < txt file.txt > which says instead of this input use this txt file
